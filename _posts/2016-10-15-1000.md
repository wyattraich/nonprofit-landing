Here at Fend, our first priority is educating people on the negative environmental and socioeconomic effects of fast-retail based consumerism. Our first endeavor will be to create a new online community where consumers can resell their goods to promote longer product life spans called fend.market. In contrast to other online marketplaces, Fend is committed to using all seller donations for good. These donations will be donated to organizations that are committed to halting climate change and furthering the work of our foundation.

Building a reliable, easy to use, and consumer friendly platform is the first key to getting users on board to end fast retail habits, and this would not be possible without the innovative technologies from our new partners at [CS-Cart](https://www.cs-cart.com/). Today, creating a space where users can see the impact of their actions has never been more important.

This is why we are extremely excited to be partnering with CS-cart to bring you fend.market, an action-based platform that lets users control how they impact the world.
